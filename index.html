Hey everyone!! <br>
Myself Khushi Saidava, have passed grade 10 <br> and entered in grade 11 this year. <br>
I'm interested in AI and am exploring this field. <br> I got to how the world is getting automated. <br> I want to generalize the education system all over the world set  <br> up on a virtual bases where students interested in a particular field can work together and l would make sure that every child of even the underdeveloped countries be a part of this system.
I've recently joined this group and am feeling great to learn  <br> something new everyday from all of you.
I'm working on several skills associated with this new era of digitalized world.<br>
